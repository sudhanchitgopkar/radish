👋 Welcome to project rad(ish).

[rad(ish)](https://radish.glitch.me) is a 💻 web app that allows small business owners to automatically place items reaching their expiration date on sale. Business owners and employees alike can either upload databases of their current inventory or use our intuitive interface to manually enter inventory information.

After data has been entered, [rad(ish)](https://radish.glitch.me) will analyze expiration dates and current list prices of database items, deciding which items should be put on sale and how much their prices should be reduced. As items get closer to their expiration date, their prices are reduced more and more! This incentivizes buying items that would otherwise be thrown away, thereby minimizing food waste and lost revenue.

## How we built it

Front-end developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript with pair-programming and initial testing done using Glitch servers.

Back-end developed with Python for CSV parsing, database analysis, and algorithmic sale allocation on inventory items.

Complete project integration done using Flask and Django.

Technologies Used:
• Python 🐍
• Flask 🍾
• Django 🔱
• HTML 🏷
• CSS ⚔️
• Javascript 〽️

## Challenges we ran into

• Integrating Python-based algorithm into the web development application, Glitch

• Front-end component responsiveness on mobile devices

• Proper CSV parsing and database management

## What's next for rad(ish)

rad(ish) wasn't built by the best coders in the world. It's not the prettiest app. It's not the most functional.
But we did give it everything we had. Going forward, we hope to continue developing and updating rad(ish) as the
rad(ish) team gets more resources, more experience, and (hopefully) more sleep.
